# Class 1: My Hobbies

Create an HTML/CSS-only webpage dedicated to one of your hobbies. This webpage should include various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links, styled using CSS to make it visually appealing. The content should provide a overview of your hobby, including why you enjoy it, how you got started, and any interesting facts or tips related to it. Be prepared to present your completed webpage in the next class.
